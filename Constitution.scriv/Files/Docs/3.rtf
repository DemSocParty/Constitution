\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The system outlined in this Constitution is not, in and of itself, a system of governance. These articles are not rules or laws, rather they are a framework for the democratic formulation of policy in the modern age. Technology has enabled a completely new conception of government, one where the people themselves are the ones doing the governing. The black line in the sand that separates those who govern from those who are governed has been obsolete for some time now. This Constitution, and the technology and legislation to come from it, is the actualization of that obsolescence.}
